# find-retran-failures.sh begins on the previous line
#

# This script uses tshark to look through a packet trace file and find TCP
# connections that appear to have failed because of retransmission issues.
# Ideally the packet trace file should be collected on the host sending the
# packets. If the trace file is collected on the receiver or at some point
# between sender and receiver it is possible failures will be missed.
#
# For each failure identified output will consist of a line containing 
# 1. the TCP stream number
# 2. the number of seconds before the last TCP segment in the file and the
#    last segment in the stream. A stream that ends with 3 retransmissions
#    0.5 seconds before the last TCP segment in the trace is less likely to
#    have failed then one that ends 200 seconds before the last TCP segment
#    since there is less time to receive the ACK. Anything less than 0.1
#    seconds is ignored    
# 3. The first IP address and the number of its unACKed bytes
# 4. The second IP address and number of its unACKed bytes

# This is followed by the last 20 lines of the TCP stream with the columns
# 1. TCP stream number
# 2. time since start of trace file (relative time)
# 3. source IP address
# 4. source port
# 5. destination IP address
# 6. destination port
# 7. IP ID (this makes it easy to spot duplicated packets)
# 8. IP TTL (makes it easy to see which IP address is local)
# 9. TCP sequence number
# 10. TCP ACK number
# 11. TCP length
# 12. FIN flag (1 == FIN)
# 13. TCP reset flag (1 == RST)
# 14. tshark expert info

# And this is followed by a list of TCP streams where the only segments in 
# the stream where SYN segments. technically these are not TCP connections
# that have failed because of retransmissions since the connection was never
# completed. 

# In addition as the script is running it prints out the stream number that
# it is currently processing. You can look at the partial results by
# monitoring the file /tmp/find-retran-failures-3.
