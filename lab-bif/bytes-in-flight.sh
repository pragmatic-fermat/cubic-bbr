# bytes-in-flight.sh begins on the previous line
#
# This macro finds the bytes in flight after each segment. Basically how
# many bytes are unACKed. This is slightly different from what Wireshark
# does. Wireshark shows the bytes in flight from when a packet is sent.
# For example if there are no outstanding bytes and the sender sends
# 32,000 bytes (we can assume TCP offloading) Wireshark will show 32,000
# bytes in flight. If a series of ACKs acks all bytes and then the sender
# sends another 32,000 bytes Wireshark will again show 32,000 bytes in flight.
# At no point will it show 0 bytes in flight. I think this is misleading
# since you cannot see that the receiver is sending multiple ACKs and the
# bytes in flight is going down to zero and then the sender sends more data.
# It also calculates the available window by subtracting the bytes in flight 
# from the last window receivied.
#
# The data probably makes more sense when the trace is captured on the sender
#
# Version 1.0 February 4, 2017
# Version 1.1 February 16, 2017
#    swapped TSHARK-FILTER and OUTPUT-FILE is the usage message and  added
#    "not tcp.flags.syn == 1" to filter out the SYN segment because tshark
#    does not include tcp.len in the SYN segment so that segment is short a
#    field which screws everything up. Also changed display to show after
#    the sender sends data so if there are multiple sends without an ACK you
#    can see the bytes in flight go up. Added the available window calculation
#    which is the last window minus the bytes in flight
# Version 1.2 April 1, 2017
#    Added copyright and GNU GPL statement and disclaimer
# Version 1.3 July 10, 2017
#     Removed the Filter argument, corrected some typos.
